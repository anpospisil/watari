## Introduction

Hello There! This is a re-design of the website [watari.ca](https://www.watari.ca/) a counselling and support services organization based out of Vancouver. In 2019, I collaborated on this project remotely with 4 other students across 4 time-zones as a requirement of graduation from McMaster University's Web Development program. Please, keep in mind that this is a high-fidelity prototype, not all links will work as desired. Also, the original site has since been updated, but the content is the same.

## The Concept

McMaster University and Watari Counselling & Support Services collaborated to allow student (like me) real-world experience re-designing a website from UX research to sketches/wireframes to a deliverable product.

‚≠êÔ∏è New technologies learned during this project.

## Goals of this project

The goal of this project is to build a full-stack app using knowledge gained during the bootcamp and incorporating new technologies learned using official documentations and googling.

- Practice full-stack development
- Apply knowledge gained from the bootcamp
- Learn and Apply new technology independently
- Showcase development process through wireframes, user stories and UML
- Practice proper commits & branching on github

## User Stories

  - As a person taking a day trip to a large city, I want to reserve a bike for the day.
  - As a person who doesn‚Äôt memorize addresses, I would like to view available bikes on a map depending on the postal code I input, so I don‚Äôt have to spend a lot of time searching for bikes.
  - As someone who loses things easily, I want a simple way to unlock/lock my Quick Bike from the App so I don‚Äôt have to fiddle with keys or locking mechanisms.
  - As a person who values their privacy and security, I want to have a dedicated profile that requires login info so that only I can see my trip and payment info.
  - As a cost-conscious user of Quick Bike, I want to see my invoices organized by week, month and year so I can budget accordingly and have a record for tax purposes.

  This mvp is still a work in progress. Some features still need to be implemented and revised.

## Wireframes

## Git Workflow

In this project I try to:

- Use descriptive commit messages
- Name branches according to feature
- Commit frequently
- Push features to development rather than master
