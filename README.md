## Introduction

Hello There! This is a re-design of the website [watari.ca](https://www.watari.ca/) a counselling and support services organization based out of Vancouver. In 2019, I collaborated with 4 other students across 4 time-zones to complete this project as the final requirement to graduate McMaster University's Web Development program. Please, keep in mind that this is a high-fidelity prototype and not all links will work as desired. 

* *the original site has since been redisgned... just imagine your best  the content is the same.*

## The Concept

McMaster University and Watari Counselling & Support Services collaborated to allow student (like me) real-world experience re-designing a website from UX research to sketches/wireframes to a deliverable product.

## Goals of this project

The goal of this project was to re-design a using UX design processes and coding languages learned over the course of the McMaster web dev program. More specifically:

- Define User stories & KPIs
- Perform several UX analyses such as: technical needs and competative
- Follow UX/UI design processes by creating sketchs, wireframs, mock-ups, low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes
- Develop web pages using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and PHP 
- Practice asynchronous collaboration using Google drive/Hangouts
