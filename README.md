## Introduction

Hello There! This is a re-design of the website [watari.ca](https://www.watari.ca/) a counselling and support services organization based out of Vancouver, CA. In 2019, I collaborated with 4 other students and the client across 5 time-zones to complete this project as the final graduation requirement of McMaster University's Web Development program. 

* *the site has since been updated, screenshot of original homepage below vvv* 

## The Concept

Watari Counselling & Support Services started in 1986 out of a basement in Vancouver. They deal with 4 main issues in the community:

1. Kids suffering from trauma
1. Indigenous families facing challenges
1. Refugees and immigration (integration)
1. Housing Subsidies (Due to Vancouver Housing crisis)

As a collaboration between Watari and McMaster University, we were tasked to re-designing their website from scratch using UX research/design processess to deliver a functional product.

## Goals of this project

The goal of this project was to re-design a site using UX design processes and coding languages learned over the course of the McMaster web dev program. More specifically:

- Define User stories & KPIs
- Perform several UX analyses such as: technical needs and competative
- Follow UX/UI design processes by creating sketchs, wireframs, mock-ups, low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes
- Develop web pages using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and PHP 
- Practice asynchronous collaboration using Google drive/Hangouts

## User Stories

## Conclusion

Our team met our goal of producing a high-fidelity prototype and scored in the 90% range for our design. Working with the people at Watari was a humbling experience. It was inspiring to see how strong and dedicated they are towards helping those in need. I was very proud to be a part of their journey and to see the positive impact web development can have towards helping individuals and organizations reach their goals.
