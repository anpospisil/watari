## Introduction

Hello There! This is a re-design of the website [watari.ca](https://www.watari.ca/) a counselling and support services organization based out of Vancouver. In 2019, I collaborated with 4 other students across 4 time-zones to complete this project as the final requirement to graduate McMaster University's Web Development program. Please, keep in mind that this is a high-fidelity prototype, not all links will work as desired. 

*the original site has since been updated, but the content is the same.

## The Concept

McMaster University and Watari Counselling & Support Services collaborated to allow student (like me) real-world experience re-designing a website from UX research to sketches/wireframes to a deliverable product.
